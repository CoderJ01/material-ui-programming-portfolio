    "Hello world! My name is Joshua and I am a software developer that currently works at a start-up called Tailored Software. My path as a programmer began in community college when I enrolled in a C/C++ course and an assembly programming course. After taking the courses, I realized that programming would be a career that I could take seriously. Several months later I enrolled in an accredited coding boot camp.",
    "The foundational languages I learned in said boot camp are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The boot camp is designed to teach students the basics of being a full-stack developer. A full-stack developer can program frontend and backend applications and can configure databases.",
    "In addition to JavaScript, students are taught how to utilize APIs in frontend applications. They are also taught to use libraries such as Bootstrap and React.js. Students also learn a software architectural pattern known as model-view-controller. With regards to backend programming, students are taught rudimentary concepts and uses of Node.js, Express.js, and RESTful APIs. As for databases, students are taught both SQL and noSQL.",
    "Given that I previously had barely any programming experience, bootcamp was a challenge. Nevertheless, I made it to the end, from month one to month six, with a cohort that dwindled to less than half its original size. After I graduated from boot camp, I practiced more with RESTful APIs on my own. I also dabbled in Python and gained a solid understanding of object-oriented programming via learning Java.",
    "Now, as Iâ€™ve mentioned before, I work as a developer at a start-up company. For the front-end, the company primarily utilizes React.js. The primary languages for the backend are Python and GraphQL. I'm a front-end developer for the company."
